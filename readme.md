## Metro is nice, but we need a terminal

#### Why I'm trying to read this?

Metro is a well designed style of layout in my view.  
It's arranged in rows and columns, which looks like arrays.  
This feature makes it well suited to programs.  
So. I hope I can code out a demo. It's my idea!  

#### Reference

I used my scaffold and Bower to organize code:

Prefers Lilyturf as templating tool:
